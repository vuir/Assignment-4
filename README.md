# Hayat Alghamdi – Portfolio Website (Assignment 4)

This project is an advanced version of my personal portfolio, extending the work completed in previous assignments (Assignment 1, 2, and 3).

It includes API integration, complex JavaScript logic, advanced state management, performance optimization, and documented AI usage as required in Assignment 4.

## Project Overview

This website serves as my personal Computer Science portfolio, showcasing my skills, projects, and contact form in a fully responsive, interactive, and high-performance design.

Assignment 4 focused on enhancing the website with improvements to fonts and CSS:

- CSS layout refinements and consistency improvements
- Font scaling and typography enhancements
- Fixed sizing issues across sections and components
- Improved spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy
- Enhanced responsive design and mobile compatibility
- Cleaned redundant CSS and simplified styling structure
